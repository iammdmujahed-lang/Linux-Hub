## 🐧 Understanding Linux

Linux is an open-source, Unix-like operating system widely used in servers, cloud platforms, DevOps, cybersecurity, and container orchestration.  
It is known for being:

- ✔ Stable & reliable  
- ✔ Highly secure  
- ✔ Lightweight & fast  
- ✔ Open-source (free)  
- ✔ Customizable  
- ✔ Used by all major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP)

Linux consists of two main parts:

1. **Kernel** (core of the OS)
2. **Userland** (packages, tools, GUI, shells)

Different **Linux distributions (flavours)** package the same kernel with different tools, package managers, and configurations.

## 🌍 Linux Distributions (Flavours)

Linux flavours are grouped into families based on package managers and architecture:

### **1️⃣ Debian Family (APT based)**
Used in DevOps, cloud servers, laptops  
- Ubuntu  
- Debian  
- Linux Mint  

### **2️⃣ RedHat / RHEL Family (YUM/DNF based)**
Used heavily in enterprises & AWS  
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)  
- CentOS Stream  
- Fedora  
- Rocky Linux  
- AlmaLinux  
- **Amazon Linux** (AWS recommended)

### **3️⃣ SUSE Family**
- openSUSE  
- SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES)

### **4️⃣ Arch Family**
- Arch Linux  
- Manjaro  

### **5️⃣ Lightweight / Special Purpose Linux**
- Alpine Linux (used in Docker images)  
- Kali Linux (security)  
- Gentoo  
- Clear Linux

## 🧠 Why DevOps Engineers Use Linux?

- All cloud servers run Linux  
- Kubernetes, Docker, CI/CD tools require Linux knowledge  
- Almost all automation is Linux-based  
- Better security and scripting support  
- SSH remote management  
- Perfect for scalable backend applications
